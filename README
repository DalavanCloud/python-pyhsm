  Installation
================

pyhsm is known to work with Python 2.6 and 2.7.

It is primarily tested using Debian/Ubuntu, but is of course
meant to work on as many platforms as possible.

pyhsm is installable in the standard-python way :

  $ cd pyhsm-$ver
  $ python setup.py install

This requires the python-setuptools (well, the package is called
that in Debian/Ubuntu).

You will also need the pyserial package (python-serial in
Debian/Ubuntu) from http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/ and, to run
the test suite, pycrypto from http://www.pycrypto.org/
(python-crypto in Debian/Ubuntu).

I use Ubuntu, so I created a PPA (Personal Package Archive) for
easy installation (and removal) on Ubuntu systems.

If you use a recent Ubuntu release, you should be able to install
python-yubico with these commands :

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fredrikt/yubico
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pyhsm

The Launchpad PPA key generated for my packages is C7E50642.
