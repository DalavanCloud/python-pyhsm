== Tests
Running these tests requires a YubiHSM.

=== Setup the device
Initialize the YubiHSM by holding down the button on it while it is inserted into a USB port.
The YubiHSM should blink slowly to indicate configuration mode.
Connect to the serial interface of the device and enter the following commands:

  HSM (keys not decrypted)> zap <enter>
  Confirm current config being erased (type yes) yes <enter> - wait - done
  NO_CFG> hsm ffffffff <enter>
  Enabled flags ffffffff = YSM_AEAD_GENERATE,YSM_BUFFER_AEAD_GENERATE,YSM_RANDOM_AEAD_GENERATE,YSM_AEAD_DECRYPT_CMP,YSM_DG
  Enter cfg password (g to generate) <enter>
  Enter admin Yubikey public id 001/008 (enter when done) <enter>
  Enter master key (g to generate)  <enter>
  Confirm current config being erased (type yes) yes <enter> - wait - done
  HSM (keys changed)> keycommit <enter> - Done
  HSM> exit <enter>

Now run the following command:

  sudo python -m test.configure_hsm

You should now be ready to run the tests.

=== Running the tests
To run the tests, have a device configured as described above, then run:

  sudo python setup.py test
